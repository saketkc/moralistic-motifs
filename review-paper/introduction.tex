\section*{Introduction}

%Hershey and Chase's experiment established DNA as the genetic material\cite{hershey_independent_1952}. 
%One of the major challenges in molecular biology has been to understand mechanism of gene regulation. 
With the completion of human genome sequence\cite{lander_initial_2001}, an imposing challenge has been to decipher its underlying its functional pattern and their biological implications. Application of emerging technology over the years has enhanced our knowledge about the regulatory genome responsible for controlling various cellular processes. Transcription factors(TFs) are DNA-binding proteins responsible for regulating expression of the gene by activating or inhibiting the transcription machinery. The TF machinery plays a central role in ma

Mutations in TFs have been known to be associated with developmental disorders \cite{epstein_transcription-factor_1996}, cancer\cite{furney_structural_2006} and other human diseases \cite{medzhitov_transcriptional_2009,sage_regulatory_2010}
