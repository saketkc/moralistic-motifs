Review of motif finders with a focus on phylogenetic footprinting

## Reviews

1. [The Next Generation of Transcription Factor Binding Site Prediction
](http://journals.plos.org/ploscompbiol/article?id=10.1371/journal.pcbi.1003214) - 2013 
  > We present a new graphical representation of the motifs that convey properties of position
  interdependence. TFFMs have been assessed on ChIP-seq data sets coming from the ENCODE project, revealing that
  they can perform better than both PWMs and the dinucleotide weight matrix extension in discriminating ChIP-seq from
  background sequences
